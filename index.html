            <h2>Lamar Alexander</h2>
            <h3>Republican</h3>
            <p>Alexander, a seventh-generation Tennessean born and raised in Maryville, was twice elected governor of Tennessee. He has always believed that in most cases the best decisions are made by those closest to the people. 

                                       
                    Alexander was first elected to the Senate in 2002 and has been re-elected twice. His Republican colleagues elected him three times to be chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. 
                    
                    He has previously served as president of the University of Tennessee and as U.S. Secretary of Education under George H.W. Bush.
                    
                    He is a classical and country pianist and the author of seven books.
                    
                    Lamar Alexander and his wife Honey have four children and eight grandchildren and a dog named Rufus. </p>
